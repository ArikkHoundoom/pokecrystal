# Pokémon Crystal [![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci]

This is an experimental personal project based on [the disassembly of Pokémon Crystal](https://www.github.com/pret/pokecrystal/).
It is meant to serve as a base for an hypothetical further modification of the game, by implementing new music and maps and fixing known glitches, essentially softmodding Pokémon Crystal. The hardmod's goals are to be determined.

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
